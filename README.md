# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I am considering the possibility of making an online calendar where individuals can input pre-existing commitments and schedule their independent working time
I want to make it sortable by multiple categories such as priority, time, and type of activity (work, recreation, chores, etc.)
Also, I want to make the site that stores the calendar capable of changing its appearance in certain events of urgency, like deadlines or reminders.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names, and who are their section leaders?

I plan to work alone.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Will I be allowed to ask instructors or teaching fellows about specific problems if I hit roadblocks for long enough?
