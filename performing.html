        <h3>My Performing Arts Experience</h3>

            <dd>
                In elementary school I had to perform two class plays every year.
                They were usually musicals that told silly stories, like
                <a href="https://www.badwolfpress.com/13-colonies-musical-play" class="external" onclick = "takeOut()">a retelling of the American Revolution</a>, or Disney movies, like <i>Lilo and Stitch</i> and <i>Peter Pan</i>.
                I did not particularly enjoy them.

            <dd>
                I took dance classes for seven years. The genres I learned included traditional Chinese dance, ballet, and jazz.

            <dt>Singing</dt>
            <dd>
                Throughout elementary school I had to sing on a regular basis for music class, so I was somewhat skilled at singing.
                Then I began middle school, where we no longer had mandatory music classes, so I stopped singing.
                Without practice, I got progressively worse at singing.
                In addition, my voice started changing and getting lower, so my vocal range is no longer suited to singing anyway.

            <dd>
                I have experience in playing the piano, violin, and recorder.
                I played the piano for about eight years in the past, but I quit before high school due to the amount of time it took.
                I started playing the violin six years ago, and I still play it now.
                I played the recorder during fourth and fifth grade because it was part of the music curriculum.

        <h3>My Preferences in Performing Arts</h3>
        <p>
            I enjoy listening to classical music, especially symphonies and concertos from the Romantic era.
            I prefer the style of Romantic era pieces because they are more expressive compared to Baroque and Classical era compositions.
        </p>
        <p>
            I used to also be interested in pop music from the last decade, particularly songs about deep or dark topics made with
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocaloid" class="external" onclick = "takeOut()">VOCALOID</a>
            engines.
            I initially began listening to VOCALOID music because most of it was in a language I didn't understand; it was good for background music while studying.
            I continued to be interested in it because I enjoyed the instrumentals as well as story-telling style of certain producers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now I also listen to
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-pop" class="external" onclick = "takeOut()">K-pop</a>
            artists whose songs are recommended to me, like BTS, Blackpink, Mamamoo, and Dreamcatcher.
