        <p>
            I enjoy reading creative works.
            I prefer fiction over other formats like poetry.
            My favorite genres are fantasy, science fiction, and humor.
        </p>
        <h3>My Tastes in Fiction</h3>
        <p>
            In elementary school I enjoyed reading fantasy novels geared towards children
            (things I could find in the children's section of libraries).
            My favorite series then were
            <a href="https://warriorcats.com/" class="external" onclick="takeOut()">Warrior Cats</a>,
            <a href="https://www.kathrynlasky.com/book-series/series/guardians-of-gahoole" class="external" onclick="takeOut()">Guardians of Ga'Hoole</a>,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_39_Clues" class="external" onclick="takeOut()">the 39 Clues</a>,
            <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page" class="external" onclick="takeOut()">Harry Potter</a>, and
            <a href="https://riordan.fandom.com/wiki/Riordan_Wiki" class="external" onclick="takeOut()">Percy Jackson</a>.
            I generally favored books about anthropomorphic animals or teenagers engaging in conflicts hidden from the mundane world.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I started middle school, popular books and series from the teen section like
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games" class="external" onclick="takeOut()">The Hunger Games</a>,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fault_in_Our_Stars" class="external" onclick="takeOut()">The Fault in Our Stars</a>,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergent_(novel)" class="external" onclick="takeOut()">Divergent</a>, and
            <a href="https://shadowhunters.fandom.com/wiki/The_Shadowhunters%27_Wiki" class="external" onclick="takeOut()">The Mortal Instruments</a> were popular, so I starting reading those books, not wanting to miss out.
        </p>
        <p>
            Around eighth grade, I started reading standalone books more often, since I ran out of trending book series to read.
            I receive recommendations from my local public library's website and my school's book club.
        </p>

        <h3>My Growing Interest in Comics</h3>

        <p>
            Right before the end of the school year in seventh grade, I was introduced to <i>manga</i>, comics originating from Japan.
            From reading <i>manga</i>, I started developing interest in emulating certain author-artists' art styles.
            In my sophomore year of high school, I began reading comics on the
            <a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/" class="external" onclick="takeOut()">WEBTOON</a> platform.
            The comics on WEBTOON are from many different countries and are unlike <i>manga</i> in how they are exclusively digital and in color.
            I enjoy a variety of genres on WEBTOON, ranging from comedy and slice-of-life to sci-fi and fantasy to horror and thriller.
