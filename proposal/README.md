# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Planner

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that lets you store and organize tasks you are planning to do.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My website will allow users to log in.
Users will be able to see a table detailing all their tasks.
Users will be able to add tasks to the table with time and description, and delete them as well.
Tasks will stand out visually if their deadline is near.
It will be executed on CS50 IDE.

## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The website will allow users to log in to a default page where they can view their tasks, listed in a table in chronological order.
The table will have start and end time as well as description.
Users will be able to add and delete tasks.
Tasks with close deadlines will be highlighted.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Tasks will be organized by more topics like priority.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Website will be visually pleasing, tasks can be edited, and tasks can overlap.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will have to study more on JavaScript and implementing databases online; my experience in creating interactive websites from scratch
is limited to CS50, where many things, like helper functions, were pre-implemented. I will have to figure out how to implement all the thing 
for that were pre-implemented in problem sets for this project. I will also have to learn more about sorting in databases.
