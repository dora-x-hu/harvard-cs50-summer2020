I have created the necessary tables to store data and made a program capable of logging in and out, registering new users, displaying tasks, and adding new tasks.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not created functions for editing and deleting tasks with the program.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I have had trouble getting accessing the local time with my program in order to choose which tasks to display (tasks whose times have already passed are not shown)
